## Abstract
Invasive species threaten natural ecosystems globally, displacing native species and causing biodiversity loss. In coastal areas with Mediterranean climate, iceplant (*Carpobrotus edulis*) has become highly invasive, forming large monospecific zones that compete for resources with native plant species, including threatened or endangered species. Despite the widespread impact of iceplant across coastal areas with a Mediterranean climate, there is no precise information on where it is and how much it has spread. This study focuses on mapping and quantifying iceplant extent along the Santa Barbara County coast in California, USA, by leveraging machine learning methods to identify iceplant in images from the 2020 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) archive at 0.6 m/pixel resolution. The result is a high-accuracy map showing iceplant locations in 2020 and statistics about the fraction of the landscape covered by this invasive species. Additionally, this study's use of open data and reproducible data analysis and validation workflow opens the door for the methods presented to be adapted and applied across California and all other Mediterranean climatic regions, plus over time to comprehend the spread and mitigation of iceplant invasions.
